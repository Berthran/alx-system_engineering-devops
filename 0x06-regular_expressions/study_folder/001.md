# Regex Basics

## Repetition tokens
| Token | 		Property		 | Regex Example|
|-------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
|{m, n}	| match exact occurences of a character/token | a{1,3}h|
| ?	| matches 0 or 1 occurrence of a token 	| a?h |
| +	| matches 1 or more occurence of a token | a+h |
| *	| matches 0 or more occurrence of a token | a\*h |	


1. "|" - the OR operator used in group matches (...)
2. "[]" - matches specific character or characters
e.g `[cmf]an` matches can, man and fan but not dan, ran or pan.
3. "[^] - excludes specific character(s)
4. "[-] - sequential range e.g [a-z] matches a single character between a to z, and [\^n-p] matches any single character between a to z except for n to p.
5. "{}" - repetition e.g w{3} matches text with 3 w.
6. "\s" - whitespace
7. "^...$" - starts and endswith
8. (?=\.pdf$) is a positive lookahead that asserts what follows the captured group is ".pdf" at the end of the string. However, it doesn't consume ".pdf", so it won't be included in the match.
