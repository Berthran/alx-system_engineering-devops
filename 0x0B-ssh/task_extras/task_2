# To connect to a server, the public key must exist in the server's ~/.ssh/authorised-keys file.
#
# To connect to a server using a private key with a passphrase
# 1. Add private key to ssh-agent to avoid the server requesting for the passphrase
# 2. Not adding the private key to ssh-agent means you'd be required to provide the passphrase to the server
