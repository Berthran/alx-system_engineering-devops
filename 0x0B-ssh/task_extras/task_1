# Display key type, number of bits and fingerprint
ssh-keygen -lf school

# This command will output something like
# `4096` is the number of bits
# `RSA` is the key type
# `SHA256:WlEG1kW is the fingerprint of the key
# To see a visual ascii representation of the fingerprint use 
# ssh-keygen -v -lf school
#

# Check if RSA key has passphrase
ssh-keygen -y -f school
# The "-y" option will read a private OpenSSH format file and
# print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.
