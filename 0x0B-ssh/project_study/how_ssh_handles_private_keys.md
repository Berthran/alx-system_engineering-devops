Your thought is partially correct, but there are some nuances to how SSH handles private keys:

### How SSH Handles Private Keys

1. **Default Key Locations**:
   - **SSH Client**: By default, the SSH client looks for private keys in the `~/.ssh` directory but does not automatically use all of them. It typically looks for keys with specific filenames, such as `id_rsa`, `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, and optionally others.

2. **Automatic Key Usage**:
   - **Configuration**: The SSH client will try keys from the `~/.ssh` directory if they are listed in the configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`) or if they are the default keys (like `id_rsa`). However, if the key is not listed in the SSH agent or explicitly mentioned in the configuration file, the client wonâ€™t automatically use it.
   - **SSH Agent**: When using an SSH agent, it holds the keys in memory. The client interacts with the agent to get the keys for authentication. If a key is not added to the agent, the client won't use it, even if it is present in the `~/.ssh` directory.

### Why Keys in `~/.ssh` Are Not Always Used Automatically

1. **Security and Performance**:
   - **Selective Use**: The SSH client does not use all keys in `~/.ssh` by default to avoid performance issues and potential security risks. Using an SSH agent to manage keys allows you to control which keys are used and ensures that the client only tries keys that are explicitly available and intended for use.

2. **Configuration Flexibility**:
   - **Custom Configurations**: Users can specify which private keys to use through the SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`). This allows for more flexibility and control over the connection settings.
   - **Explicit Key Use**: You can also specify a particular private key to use with the `-i` option in the SSH command, like `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_web_server user@host`.

### Implementing Automatic Key Usage

To implement automatic key usage without manually adding them to the SSH agent, you would typically:

1. **Add Keys to SSH Agent**:
   - Use `ssh-add` to add the keys to the SSH agent. This way, the agent can handle them, and the SSH client will use them for authentication.

2. **Configure SSH Client**:
   - Configure the SSH client to use specific keys by editing the `~/.ssh/config` file. For example:

     ```plaintext
     Host example.com
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_web_server
     ```

3. **Use Key Management Tools**:
   - Use tools or scripts to manage your SSH keys, ensuring that all required keys are loaded into the SSH agent.

In summary, while the SSH client does check the `~/.ssh` directory for private keys, it relies on the SSH agent for managing keys and authenticating connections. Adding keys to the agent or configuring the client to use specific keys provides a more controlled and secure approach.
