Yes, it is a conventional practice to use `mysqldump` for relatively smaller databases and physical backups (such as MySQL Enterprise Backup) for larger databases. However, there are trade-offs and considerations that you should be aware of when choosing between these backup methods.

### Using `mysqldump` for Smaller Databases

**Advantages**:
1. **Simplicity**: `mysqldump` is straightforward to use, with simple command-line options.
2. **Portability**: The SQL dump file is highly portable and can be easily transferred to different MySQL servers, including those on different platforms.
3. **Selective Backup and Restore**: You can back up and restore specific tables or databases, providing flexibility in managing your data.
4. **Human-Readable**: The SQL dump file is human-readable, which can be useful for debugging and manual edits.

**Trade-offs**:
1. **Performance Impact**: Generating the dump and restoring from it can be resource-intensive, affecting the performance of the database server, especially for larger databases.
2. **Longer Backup and Restore Times**: As the database size grows, the time required to create and restore backups increases significantly.

### Using Physical Backups for Larger Databases

**Advantages**:
1. **Performance**: Physical backups are faster to create and restore, especially for large databases, as they involve direct file copying.
2. **Minimal Impact**: Physical backups generally have less impact on the running database, as they can use snapshot technologies that capture the state of the database without heavy processing.
3. **Consistency**: They provide a consistent state of the database, capturing all transactions up to the point of the backup.
4. **Scalability**: More suitable for handling large volumes of data efficiently.

**Trade-offs**:
1. **Complexity**: Physical backup tools can be more complex to set up and use, requiring additional configuration and understanding of the underlying storage mechanisms.
2. **Platform Dependency**: Physical backups may be more tightly coupled with specific database versions and storage formats, making cross-platform migrations more challenging.
3. **Cost**: Enterprise-level tools like MySQL Enterprise Backup can be costly compared to the free `mysqldump` utility.

### Summary of Trade-offs

- **Database Size**: For small to medium-sized databases, `mysqldump` is often sufficient and easier to manage. For very large databases, physical backups offer better performance and efficiency.
- **Performance Impact**: If minimizing the impact on the running database is crucial, physical backups are preferable.
- **Backup and Restore Speed**: Physical backups are faster for both backup and restore operations, which is critical for large databases or environments with tight recovery time objectives.
- **Cost and Complexity**: While `mysqldump` is free and simpler to use, physical backup solutions can be more complex and potentially more costly but offer significant advantages for large-scale deployments.

### Practical Approach

In practice, many organizations use a combination of both methods:
- **Small to Medium Databases**: Use `mysqldump` for regular backups due to its simplicity and ease of use.
- **Large Databases**: Use physical backup tools for regular backups to leverage their speed and efficiency. They might still use `mysqldump` for specific tasks, such as exporting data for migration or generating schema definitions.

By understanding these trade-offs, you can make informed decisions based on your specific needs, database size, performance requirements, and resource availability.
