## Logical backup
The term `logical` backup implies that the `msqldump` utility will *produce a `set of SQL statements` that, when `executed`, can `recreate the database structure and data`.*
This is different from a physical backup, which involves copying the actual database files.

Let's break down the reasons for using logical backups like those created by `mysqldump`, and when physical backups might be preferable.

### Why Use Logical Backups with `mysqldump`?

1. **Portability**:
   - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Logical backups are SQL scripts that can be run on any MySQL server, regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware.
   - **Migration**: They are ideal for migrating databases from one server to another, even if the servers have different configurations or platforms.

2. **Ease of Use**:
   - **Readability**: The SQL script is human-readable and can be manually edited if needed.
   - **Selective Restoration**: You can restore specific parts of the database (e.g., certain tables or rows) without restoring the entire database.

3. **Flexibility**:
   - **Format Options**: `mysqldump` can generate backups in different formats like SQL, CSV, or XML, which can be useful for different purposes such as data analysis or import into other systems.

4. **Backup and Restore Simplicity**:
   - **Simple Commands**: Using `mysqldump` and `mysql` to back up and restore databases involves straightforward commands.
   - **Automation**: Easily scriptable for automated backups and restores.

### Why Not Just Use the Original Database?

1. **Data Integrity**:
   - **Protection Against Corruption**: Regular backups ensure that you have a copy of the database that can be restored in case the original database gets corrupted.
   - **Disaster Recovery**: In case of hardware failure, accidental deletion, or other disasters, a backup allows you to restore the database to a previous state.

2. **Testing and Development**:
   - **Environment Replication**: Backups can be used to create a testing or development environment that mirrors the production environment.
   - **Safe Experimentation**: Developers can safely test changes on a backup without affecting the live database.

### Why Not Use Physical Backups Instead of Logical Backups?

1. **Granularity**:
   - **Table-Level Backup**: Logical backups allow you to back up specific tables or parts of the database, which is not as straightforward with physical backups.

2. **Restoration Flexibility**:
   - **Selective Restoration**: Logical backups enable restoring specific parts of the database without needing to restore the entire database.

3. **Storage and Transfer**:
   - **Smaller Size**: Logical backups, especially when compressed, are often smaller in size compared to physical backups, making them easier to store and transfer.

4. **Version Independence**:
   - **MySQL Version Compatibility**: Logical backups are more likely to be compatible across different versions of MySQL, whereas physical backups might not work if there are significant differences between versions.

### When to Use Physical Backups?

1. **Performance**:
   - **Faster Backup and Restore**: Physical backups can be faster to create and restore, especially for large databases, as they involve copying binary files directly.

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Point-in-Time Recovery**: With tools like MySQL Enterprise Backup or LVM snapshots, you can achieve point-in-time recovery, capturing the exact state of the database at a specific moment.

3. **Large Databases**:
   - **Efficiency**: For very large databases, physical backups might be more efficient in terms of time and resources.

### Summary

- **Logical Backups**: Provide flexibility, portability, and ease of use. Ideal for migrations, selective restores, and environments requiring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Physical Backups**: Offer faster backup and restore times and are more suitable for large databases and scenarios requiring point-in-time recovery.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both logical and physical backups, you can choose the right strategy for your specific needs and ensure that your database is well-protected.
